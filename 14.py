# Python documentation strings (or docstrings) provide a convenient way of associating documentation with
# Python modules, functions, classes, and methods. It’s specified in source code that is used, like a comment,
# to document a specific segment of code. Unlike conventional source code comments, the docstring should describe
# what the function does, not how.
# Declaring Docstrings: The docstrings are declared using ”’triple single quotes”’ or “”” triple double quotes “””
# just below the class, method, or function declaration. All functions should have a docstring.
# # Accessing Docstrings: The docstrings can be accessed using the __doc__ method of the object or using the help
# function. The below examples demonstrate how to declare and access a docstring.
def square(n):
    '''
